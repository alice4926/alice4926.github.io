<p> <br> I love eating, cooking and baking! Before I come to UC Davis for my master degree, I used to plan to enroll in the program in Le Cordon Bleu. Also, I enjoyed travel. During the summer break in 2016, my friend and I went on a road trip and drove 17000 miles in 66 days to made our dream of traveling around the United State come true!!
