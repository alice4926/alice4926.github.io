<h3>About me</h3>

  Hi! I am Alice. I am now a Master student in Statistics at University of California Davis and will graduate on June 2017.
  I enjoy identifying the underlying patterns from the collected data, and applying mathematical and statistical models to solve practical problems.
  I have skills in R, Python, SQL, Tableau, and Git.
