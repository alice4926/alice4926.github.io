<h2><strong>When Is the Best Time to Look for a Job for Women?</strong></h2>
<h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p> 
        In this project, our goal is to identify a model best fitting the time series monthly unemployment data for female aged 16-19 years from 1948-1981.
        The data is a summary of monthly employment survey of 60,000 households, conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor.
        People are classified as unemployed if they did not work during the survey week, or if they make efforts to find a job in the previous few weeks, or if they were available for work during the survey week. 
        Figure 1 shows the rising of unemployment rate of 408 months. 
        The moving average smoothing line emphasizes the upward trend in the series throughout these 30 years. 
        The seasonal pattern of adult female unemployment shows twin peaks across the year. 
        It increases at the beginning of the year, then declines through the first six months, and rises again and declines after Christmas.2
        In order to analyze the unemployment rate, we first transformed the data to stabilize the series. 
        Then, we built several time series regression models to fit the data and then evaluated the models by Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
